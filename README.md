# Data-Analysis
Hi

In this project I have analyzed the Music store data analysis data set which I have downloaded from the Kaggle.




There are some problem statements given to us by the music store to help them to analyze the data and provide meaningful insights that help them to grow their business.



Database and Tools


•	Postgre SQL

•	PgAdmin4



Schema- Music Store Database

This schema is very useful while solving the queries that involve tables joining.

This schema also describes us the keys of individual table to use them while joining.

The questions asked by store were provided in the sql sheet as comments.
